A group of individuals stole mobile telephones, two USB flash drives and a hard drive from the embassy and handed them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States. The event took place after the Singapore summit between North Korea (DPRK) and the United States and prior to the approach of the Hanoi summit. As of early April 2019, one person had been arrested in connection with the incident and two international arrest warrants had been issued by the Spanish Audiencia Nacional. The suspected perpetrators are citizens of Mexico, the US and South Korea, although the latter two governments denied any connection with the incident.",

A group of individuals stole mobile telephones, two USB flash drives and a hard drive from the embassy and handed them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States.
